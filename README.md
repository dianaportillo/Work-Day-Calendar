# Work Day Calendar
## Create a calendar schedule to keep track of a day to day life.

-- Overview 
Creating a schedule to maintain an organized and effective schedule to keep track of daily activites.
I have also added a add to work calendar button to also schedule any appointments if needed.

### The Challenge:
Creating a timed quiz using Javascript that creates a timed session for a user to answer the questions.
If any question is answered incorrectly the timer must penalize by 5 seconds. At the end of the game their score will
be the time they had left. They will have the option to save their high score in a local storage to view.

### User Story: 
"AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively"

### Acceptance Criteria:
"GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist"
